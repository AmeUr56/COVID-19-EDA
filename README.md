# Project Idea: 
EDA on COVID-19 Dataset

## Overview  
This project explores and analyzes the **COVID-19 dataset** using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. The goal is to understand trends, patterns, and insights from the data.  

## Tools and Libraries  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations  

# The Dataset: 
COVID-19 Pandemic by Our World in Data.
